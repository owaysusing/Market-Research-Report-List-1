<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The basic ICU ventilators market is primarily divided into two types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes to deliver air directly into the lungs, suitable for critically ill patients requiring mechanical support. In contrast, non-invasive ventilation employs masks or nasal devices to assist breathing without airway intubation, aimed at patients with respiratory issues who may benefit from less intrusive methods. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure in intensive care settings.</p></p>
