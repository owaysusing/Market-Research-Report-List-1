<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Haemodialysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The haemodialysers market is categorized into two main types based on membrane characteristics: low flux and high flux membranes. Low flux membranes allow smaller molecules like urea to pass through while retaining larger proteins, making them suitable for patients with stable kidney function. In contrast, high flux membranes facilitate the removal of larger waste molecules and excess fluid, providing improved clearance and better outcomes for patients with significant renal impairment. Each type caters to specific patient needs in dialysis treatments.</p></p>
